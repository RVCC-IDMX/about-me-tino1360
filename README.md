### Hello! This my personal website that I created for a college class called "Web Page Development I". It showcases information about me such as my life goals, my hobbies, a photo gallery, a piece of literature, a video that I created, and a contact form where you can reach out to me. I look foward to showcasing this site to people such as my family, friends, teachers, and a job interviewer. I worked really hard on this project and enjoyed doing it, and I learned how to write HTML and CSS, along with all the properties that are used in them. The color scheme that I chose for my website I found on Instagram, however it was lost most likely due to me unsaving it by accident at some point in time. The colors I used are as follows:


* #CCA152
* #9DB3BE
* #58626E
* #314657
* #FFFFFF


##### *I give complete credit to whoever put together this color scheme, even though I am unable to identify them.

### I am proud to say that everything you see on this website was created by me using my own imagination. Other than my color scheme, I have no need to give other credits to anyone else. For my license for this website, I chose to reserve a copyright license which I applied in the footer of my webpage.

## I hope you enjoyed stopping by!
